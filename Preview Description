So I began my project by compiling a list of various sounds that I sourced online from Freesound. A part of my narrative has to deal with me getting ready before going out to the bars with friends. I found a clip of a blow-dryer so I'm going to use that in addition to  a recording of me straightening my hair, tying my shoes, and the sound of me rummaging through make up. I also sourced iPhone texting, car horns, car doors opening and closing, and various sounds of shot glasses clinking together and being slid across a table. In audacity I began by chronologically organizing my sounds from the things I wanted to start first being at the top of the screen and then things happening at the end of my project being placed towards the bottom. My project doesn’t really sound like anything substantial right now, it’s more of just me getting organized and collecting sounds and music. I also cut up and split the shot glass clip I found online because the one I sourced has sliding, pouring, and clinking. By splitting it up and placing each individual shot glass sound onto another track I hope to stay more organized. I also messed around a bit with the volume of certain tracks because some of the sources I found were either incredibly too loud or quiet. Over the weekend, I hope to record some things of my own from being at home to going out with other people. I want to make my project as authentic as possible. Right now, I am not going to mess with the disfiguration of my sounds as much. I want to do that in the end, but for now my goal is to build a story and set the tone for my overall project.

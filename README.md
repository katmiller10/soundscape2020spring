Sound project recording and composing sound to describe a location and create a story. Possibly something within movies or describing life in the apartment

This is my final soundscape narrative titled, A Loud Night Out. It tracks the sounds and noises of me getting ready and then going out to the bars with my friends. I recorded almost all of the sounds when I was at a bar in Southside so that the caotic atmosphere of going out on the weekend would be captured authentically and realistically.
